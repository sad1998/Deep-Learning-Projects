Projects related to Deep Learning Algorithms

This is an image classification project.
Concepts and algorithms used:
  - Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
  - Classification using Transfer Learning

The project attempts to classify an image dataset containing 3 object classes and 1 background class using CNNs. 
The classification has been done using
  - A custom baseline CNN model which has been tuned to improve classification performance
  - Transfer Learning has been implemented using SOTA cnn architectures VGG-19 and ResNet
